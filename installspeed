Script Hook V Installation
1. Copy ScriptHookV.dll to the game's main folder, i.e. where GTA5.exe is located.

2. In order to load asi plugins you need to have asi loader installed, you can download it separately or use the latest version that comes with this distrib (dinput8.dll). You must delete previous asi loader version (dsound.dll) if you have one installed.

3. This distrib also includes a sample asi plugin - native trainer, if you need a trainer then copy NativeTrainer.asi too.
